Or hope it’s one of the billions of strings in a “rainbow table” or online lookup.\n\nHere’s a concrete way to proceed:\n\n1. Save your hash in a file, e.g. hash.txt containing:\n   1f9a79d1558e247ee2390443c74b8486d0157469f263c88632edec49c719919b\n\n2. If you think it’s a dictionary word or common phrase, run Hashcat in dictionary mode:\n   ```bash\n   hashcat -m 1400 -a 0 hash.txt \/path\/to\/wordlist.txt\n   ```\n   (‘-m 1400’ is SHA-256.)\n\n3. If you believe it’s a fixed-length lowercase alpha string, you can brute‐force it with a mask:\n   ```bash\n   # example: try all 8-letter lowercase\n   hashcat -m 1400 -a 3 hash.txt ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l\n   ```\n\n4. If it’s a typical CTF flag of the form CTF{…}, you can use a hybrid attack (dictionary + mask) or custom mask to fill in the braces and known prefix. For example, if you know it starts with “flag{” and ends with “}” and has 8 chars in between:\n   ```bash\n   hashcat -m 1400 -a 3 hash.txt flag\\{?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1\\} -1 ?l?d\n   ```\n\n5. Let it run. If the space is small enough (e.g. 8 lowercase letters is 26^8 ≈ 200 billion – maybe too big, but 6 letters is 26^6 ≈ 308 million – feasible), Hashcat will eventually spit out the plaintext.\n\nAs SHA-256 is designed to resist preimage attacks, there is no direct “invert” function. You must narrow down the candidate space yourself (by format, prefix, length, charset, or known dictionary) and then brute‐force or lookup.\n\nIf you do that on this hash, you will eventually recover the original input string. Final answer: Use a brute‐force or dictionary attack (e.g. Hashcat -m 1400) against that hash to reveal the flag text.",

Even in the cores of massive stars it takes temperatures of T ~ 2–4×10⁹ K (kT ∼ 0.2–0.4 MeV) and densities high enough that the typical collision energies are on the order of hundreds of keV up to a few MeV, and iron is only built up only after silicon burning and other late‐stage processes.\n\nIf you insist on a bare‐minimum “threshold” energy for a single α + p encounter you look at the Coulomb barrier between Z₁=2 and Z₂=1:\n\n barrier ≈ Z₁Z₂·e²\/(4πε₀R)  \n       ≈ (2·1·1.44 MeV·fm)\/(1.2 fm·(A₁¹ᐟ³ + A₂¹ᐟ³))  \n       ≈ 1 MeV  (roughly)\n\nSo:\n\n•  To overcome the α + p barrier you need at least ~1 MeV of center-of-mass energy (in practice you’d accelerate the He²⁺ to ~1–2 MeV in the lab frame).  \n•  But to build up all the way to Fe you then need dozens more captures, each with its own barrier (up to ~10–20 MeV for α + Si or α + S, etc.), plus β‐decays, and in the end you’d have had to supply hundreds of MeV in total.\n\nBottom line:  \n1) A one-shot α + p → Fe reaction does not exist.  \n2) The bare α+p Coulomb‐barrier threshold is ~1 MeV, so that’s the minimum He²⁺ energy needed to fuse with a proton at all.  \n3) Producing iron requires a long chain of fusion and decay steps, total energies ∼500 MeV.  \n\nFinal answer: There is no single‐collision α + H → Fe channel.
