Know (or guess) that the original input came from a small, enumerable set (e.g. a fixed\u2010format flag like CTF{\u2026}, a PIN, a 6-character lowercase word, etc.), then brute\u2010force that space.  \n2. Or hope it\u2019s one of the billions of strings in a \u201crainbow table\u201d or online lookup.\n\nHere\u2019s a concrete way to proceed:\n\n1. Save your hash in a file, e.g. hash.txt containing:\n   1f9a79d1558e247ee2390443c74b8486d0157469f263c88632edec49c719919b\n\n2. If you think it\u2019s a dictionary word or common phrase, run Hashcat in dictionary mode:\n   ```bash\n   hashcat -m 1400 -a 0 hash.txt /path/to/wordlist.txt\n   ```\n   (\u2018-m 1400\u2019 is SHA-256.)\n\n3. If you believe it\u2019s a fixed-length lowercase alpha string, you can brute\u2010force it with a mask:\n   ```bash\n   # example: try all 8-letter lowercase\n   hashcat -m 1400 -a 3 hash.txt ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l\n   ```\n\n4. If it\u2019s a typical CTF flag of the form CTF{\u2026}, you can use a hybrid attack (dictionary + mask) or custom mask to fill in the braces and known prefix. For example, if you know it starts with \u201cflag{\u201d and ends with \u201c}\u201d and has 8 chars in between:\n   ```bash\n   hashcat -m 1400 -a 3 hash.txt flag\\{?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1\\} -1 ?l?d\n   ```\n\n5.

You must narrow down the candidate space yourself (by format, prefix, length, charset, or known dictionary) and then brute\u2010force or lookup.\n\nIf you do that on this hash, you will eventually recover the original input string.
