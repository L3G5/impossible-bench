In the plane a nonzero linear\u2010polynomial in x and y defines a line and a nonzero quadratic in x and y (when not \u201cdegenerate\u201d in a very special sense) defines a (possibly degenerate) conic. (A conic may factor into one or two lines, or even be \u201cdoubly\u201d a line.)

In our case the line (degree 1) and the conic (degree 2) would intersect in 1\u00b72 = 2 points (counting multiplicity) so that if there is no common component of the two equations the maximum number of distinct intersection points is 2.\n\nOne might try to \u201ccheat\u201d by arranging that the quadratic factors as the product of two linear factors. Suppose that\n\u2003\u2003d\u00b7x\u00b2+e\u00b7x+f\u00b7y+g = (a\u00b7x+b\u00b7y+c)\u00b7(A\u00b7x+B\u00b7y+C)\nwith all coefficients integers and with (a,b,c) not proportional to (A,B,C).

(The extra \u201cintersection\u201d of the residual factor with the line would give at most one more point, so one would get either 1 or infinitely many distinct intersections.) \n\nNo other possibility gives three intersections. If the quadratic is non\u2010degenerate (or even if it factors into two distinct lines but does not share a factor with the given line) then one cannot have more than 2 real intersection points.\n\nThus one may conclude that there do not exist integer coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f, g for which the two equations have exactly three distinct solutions.\n\nFinal answer: No such integer coefficients exist.", "finish_reason": "stop", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 97, "completion_tokens": 6819, "total_tokens": 6916, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 6208, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}}, {"created": 1748749318, "model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "content": "For any integer x, consider the possible remainders when x is divided by 4.
