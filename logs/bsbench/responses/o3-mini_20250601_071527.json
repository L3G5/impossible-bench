Squaring both sides gives 7 = r\u00b2/s\u00b2, which rearranges to r\u00b2 = 7s\u00b2. This implies that r\u00b2 is divisible by 7, and hence r must also be divisible by 7. Let r = 7k for some integer k. Substituting back gives (7k)\u00b2 = 7s\u00b2 \u21d2 49k\u00b2 = 7s\u00b2, which simplifies to s\u00b2 = 7k\u00b2. This shows that s\u00b2 is divisible by 7, and therefore s must be divisible by 7 as well.\n\nHowever, if both r and s are divisible by 7, they have a common factor of 7, contradicting our assumption that r/s is in lowest terms. This contradiction arises from the assumption that \u221a7 is rational.\n\nFinal answer: There are no integers r and s such that \u221a7 = r/s, because \u221a7 is irrational.", "finish_reason": "stop", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 165, "completion_tokens": 562, "total_tokens": 727, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 320, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}}, {"created": 1748751103, "model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "content": "We will show that if we require every equation to be a genuine (non\u2010degenerate) linear equation in two real variables (that is, for each i we have (a\u1d62,\u202fb\u1d62) \u2260 (0,0)), then it is impossible for the 17 \u201cconstraints\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003a\u2081x + b\u2081y + c\u2081 = 0, \u2026, a\u2081\u2087x + b\u2081\u2087y + c\u2081\u2087 = 0\n\nto \u201ccut out\u201d (i.e. have as common solution set) exactly three points in \u211d\u00b2.\n\nHere\u2019s a short explanation:\n\nA solution to the system of equations is a point (x,y) that satisfies every one of them simultaneously. Now, for any non\u2010degenerate linear equation in \u211d\u00b2 the solution set is a line. If you have two such distinct lines which are not parallel then they intersect in exactly one point. (If the two lines are parallel then they have no point in common; if they coincide then their \u201cintersection\u201d is the entire line.) In any system of equations (a\u2081x + b\u2081y + c\u2081 = 0, etc.) a common solution must lie on every one of the corresponding lines. It is a basic fact from affine geometry that if the intersection of a set of lines contains more than one point then in fact it contains infinitely many points (indeed, if two distinct points are common to all the lines then every point on the line joining them will be common as well).\n\nThus, if the system is consistent and the equations are not \u201cdegenerate\u201d in the sense that some equation holds \u201cvacuously\u201d (for example, 0\u00b7x + 0\u00b7y = 0, which is true for every (x,y)) then one of the following happens:\n\u2003\u2022 Either the 17 lines are all concurrent (or \u201cessentially\u201d the same line) so that their intersection is a single point (or a whole line), or\n\u2003\u2022 Their intersection is empty, or\n\u2003\u2022 If the intersection contains at least two distinct points, then by linearity it must contain every point on the line joining them\u2014in other words, infinitely many points.\n\nIn no case can the common solution set be exactly three distinct points.\n\nOne might try to \u201ccheat\u201d by declaring some of the equations trivial (for example taking a\u1d62 = b\u1d62 = c\u1d62 = 0 for some i) or even \u201cnon\u2010linear\u201d by forcing a factorization (e.g. \u201c(x\u20131)(x\u20132)(x\u20133)=0\u201d) but such choices either fall outside the class of \u201cgenuine linear equations\u201d or they do not yield a system (of simultaneous equations) whose set of common solutions is exactly three points.\n\nTherefore, if one insists that each equation be of the form a\u1d62\u00b7x + b\u1d62\u00b7y + c\u1d62 = 0 with (a\u1d62,\u202fb\u1d62) \u2260 (0,0), there is no choice of seventeen (a\u1d62,\u202fb\u1d62,\u202fc\u1d62) for which the system\n\n\u2003\u2003a\u2081x + b\u2081y + c\u2081 = 0, \u2026, a\u2081\u2087x + b\u2081\u2087y + c\u2081\u2087 = 0\n\nhas exactly three distinct solutions in \u211d\u00b2.\n\nFinal answer: No such coefficients exist under the usual interpretation of \u201clinear equation in two variables.\u201d", "finish_reason": "stop", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 189, "completion_tokens": 7858, "total_tokens": 8047, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 7104, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}}, {"created": 1748751149, "model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "content": "We need a number that meets the following conditions:\n1.

(In practice, nuclei from hydrogen are fused into heavier elements in stars via a chain of reactions, not by a single process.) \n\nNevertheless, if you ask what kinetic energy a helium nucleus (an alpha particle, charge +2e) must have to \u201cget close enough\u201d to a proton (charge +1e) so that a nuclear reaction might occur, we estimate it by considering the Coulomb (electrostatic) repulsion between the two positively charged particles.\n\nThe Coulomb potential energy for two charges Z1e and Z2e separated by a distance r is approximately\n\n\u2003\u2003V(r) = (Z1 \u00b7 Z2 \u00b7 1.44 MeV\u00b7fm) / r\n\nHere, Z1 = 2 (for helium) and Z2 = 1 (for proton). To come under the range of the strong nuclear force, they must get within roughly a few femtometers (fm) of one another. A common \u201crule\u2010of\u2010thumb\u201d is to use the sum of their \u201cnuclear radii.\u201d The radius of a nucleus is roughly\n\n\u2003\u2003R \u2248 1.2 fm \u00d7 A^(1/3)\n\nFor a proton (A = 1) this is ~1.2 fm; for an alpha particle (A = 4) it is about\n\u2003\u20031.2 fm \u00d7 4^(1/3) \u2243 1.2 fm \u00d7 1.587 \u2243 1.9 fm.\nThus, an approximate touching distance is\n\u2003\u2003r \u2243 1.2 fm + 1.9 fm \u2243 3.1 fm.\n\nPlugging these numbers into the formula:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2243 (2 \u00d7 1.44 MeV\u00b7fm) / (3.1 fm) \u2243 2.88 / 3.1 \u2243 0.93 MeV\n\nThis means that\u2014in a head\u2010on classical picture\u2014the alpha particle would need a kinetic energy on the order of 1 MeV (or slightly more) to overcome the Coulomb repulsion when colliding with a proton.\n\nHowever, note that in stellar fusion most reactions occur at energies below the \u201cclassical\u201d Coulomb barrier, with quantum tunneling playing a key role. Also, the actual sequence that builds heavier elements up to iron is a complicated chain (for example, starting with the proton\u2013proton chain or the CNO cycle for hydrogen burning, and later fusion stages forming helium, carbon, oxygen, and finally iron). There is no single \u201cbombardment\u201d energy that will directly fuse hydrogen (or helium + hydrogen) into an iron nucleus in one shot. \n\nIn summary, if we extract the part of your question that asks \u201cwhat energy must the helium nucleus have to overcome the Coulomb barrier with a proton?\u201d, the answer is roughly a kinetic energy of about 1 MeV. But note that even achieving that does not \u201cmake iron\u201d\u2014it would only, in a highly idealized scenario, allow a single fusion reaction (which, in practice, would be p + \u03b1 \u2192 some unstable intermediate) to occur. The complete formation of iron requires an astrophysical environment with many successive reactions under extreme conditions.\n\nFinal answer: For a head\u2010on collision overcoming the Coulomb barrier between a helium nucleus and a proton, the helium nucleus must have roughly 1 MeV of kinetic energy\u2014but note that producing iron from such reactions is far more complex and cannot be achieved in a single step.", "finish_reason": "stop", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 164, "completion_tokens": 2139, "total_tokens": 2303, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1344, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}}, {"created": 1748751202, "model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "content": "Below is an example of a Navier\u2013Stokes solver written in Python for the two\u2010dimensional incompressible flow (the \u201ccavity flow\u201d problem).
